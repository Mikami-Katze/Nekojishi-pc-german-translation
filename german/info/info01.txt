Guardian Tiger (虎爺, Huye)

Huye (lit."Lord Tiger") is a god in Chinese folk religion who is generally worshiped in temples of other Chinese deities. 

With the appearance of a tiger, Huye is usually believed to be the guardian of other gods. Therefore, in Nekojishi Huye is referred to as a "Guardian Tiger".

To many folks, Guardian Tigers not only protect gods themselves, but also protect the treasuries of gods. Therefore some people consider Huye as symbols of wealth. It's also believed that Guardian Tigers can protect children and cure ill patients. It is said that they are also particularly good at treating tonsillitis.

Traditionally, people provide Guardian Tigers raw eggs and meats as offerings. In the modern world, rumours have it that Guardian Tigers love Kentucky Fried Chicken. However, not all Guardian Tigers prefer KFC to raw meat. It is advised that those who bring KFC as offerings should also bring raw meats along.

Beigang Chao-Tian Temple and Hsin-Kang Mazu Temple (aka. Hsin-Kang Fengtian Gong) are two famous temples that worship Huye and organise related events.
